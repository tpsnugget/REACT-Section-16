# Part Two: Fix Clicking Dice
   In Game.js, bound toggleLocked in the constructor. No longer crashes when clicking
   on the dice. But, the correct dice are not toggled.

   In Die.js, added a constructor to properly pass the die index to toggleLocked in
   Game.js

# Part Four: Add Missing Rules
   Fixed the FullHouse and SmallStraight rules

# Part Five: Prevent Rolling More than 3 times
   Added a conditional statement to roll() in Games.js
