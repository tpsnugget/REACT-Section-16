# Part Two: Fix Clicking Dice
   In Game.js, bound toggleLocked in the constructor. No longer crashes when clicking
   on the dice. But, the correct dice are not toggled.

   In Die.js, added a constructor to properly pass the die index to toggleLocked in
   Game.js

# Part Four: Add Missing Rules
   Fixed the FullHouse and SmallStraight rules

# Part Five: Prevent Rolling More than 3 times
   Added a conditional statement to roll() in Games.js

# Part Six: Disallow Re-Usign the Score Line
   Done, but that took a while to figure out

# Part Seven: Add Descriptions
   Done.
   The Upper scores don't automatically generate a new roll while the Lower
   scores do.

# Part 8: Add Icons
   Done. See written notes about using npm, react and fontawesome.
